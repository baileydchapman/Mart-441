The version that ChatGPT created me was very similar to my format but a tad more simple. 
I think I could explain the code that the AI gave me for this model.
I'm not sure if I think that the work is mine, I believe that AI is a tool and it needs to be prompted in order to spit out results, but I don't know if I would claim that work as "mine," per say.
